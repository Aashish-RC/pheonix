## Feature Flags (Non-Gateway Modules)

The following non-gateway subsystems belong to outer layers and are temporarily hosted in the gateway repository behind explicit environment feature flags (**OFF by default**):

| Feature Flag | Default | Home Layer | Gated Endpoint(s) | Description |
|:---|:---:|:---|:---|:---|
| `FEATURE_CONSOLE_UI` | `false` | App Surface | `GET /console`, `GET /public` | Web admin control console and interactive playground UI. |
| `FEATURE_MCP` | `false` | Layer 1 tool registry | `GET /v1/mcp/tools`, `POST /v1/mcp/execute` | Model Context Protocol tool registry and tool-call execution loop. |
| `FEATURE_TOOL_SEARCH` | `false` | Layer 1 tool registry | `POST /v1/tools/search` | Dynamic semantic tool search and ranking over tool schemas. |
| `FEATURE_A2A` | `false` | Layer 2 orchestration | `POST /v1/a2a/tasks` | Agent-to-Agent routing protocol task dispatch and capability matching. |
| `FEATURE_SECRETS_SYNC` | `false` | Layer 0 vault | `POST /v1/secrets/sync` | External secrets manager synchronization (Vault/Infisical). The core H3 key-lookup hook remains active regardless. |
| `FEATURE_GEOIP` | `false` | Layer 0 Security | Perimeter Middleware | GeoIP country residency enforcement and abuse IP blacklisting. |
| `FEATURE_VOICE_LEASES` | `false` | Layer 0 Metering | Realtime Audio Hook | Voice turn duration metering and preflight session leases. |
| `FEATURE_PREPAID_CREDITS` | `false` | Layer 0 Metering | Telemetry Audit Hook | Prepaid credit gating preflight checks and automated balance webhooks. |

When any flag is off, the module is not imported at startup and its routes are not registered (returning HTTP 404).

## Architecture Overview

### ra1 Integration Hooks
- **H1 Contract (`IGatewayEngine`)**: Standardized ra1 interface decoupling high-level orchestration from execution.
- **H2 Permission & Identity Hook (`beforeRequest`, `identityHook`)**: Identity verification (defaults to anonymous for untrusted requests) and access authorization.
- **H3 Key Lookup Hook (`onKeyLookup`)**: Dynamic runtime credential resolution from vault.
- **H4 Audit Hook (`onAuditRecord`)**: Telemetry per request (actor, model, provider, tokens, latency, cost).

### Routing & Resilience
- **Dual Stream Failover**: Pre-first-byte abort & fallback timeout; post-first-byte explicit SSE error guarantees against duplicate tokens.
- **Cooldown Tracking**: Automated cooldown tracking, circuit breaker, and escape routing to local runtimes (Ollama, llama.cpp, LocalAI).
- **Local provider networking**: Local provider routes can reach RFC1918 private addresses (such as Docker Compose service IPs); reserved and link-local destinations remain blocked.
- **Virtual Tiers**: Smart, fast, vision, and embedding routing tiers with load distribution and failover.

### Security & Privacy
- **Reversible PII Masking**: Inbound sensitive entities are substituted with surrogate tokens using the `[TOKEN_<TYPE>_<HEX>]` format before upstream dispatch and restored downstream.
